# Linguify-OpenAI-Natural-Language-to-SQL-Converter
This Python script facilitates seamless conversion of user queries into SQL statements for execution within a Pandas DataFrame context. The script offers a modular function that converts user-defined queries into valid SQL syntax, allowing users to directly query their DataFrame using SQL-like expressions.


This is on more similar lines to that of Table Question answering instead of conversational one.

# How to use

The py script in the **api_test_Tab_QA** repository requires a CSV-formatted **data file** (other data sources can be used with minor adjustments) and **user-input queries**. Ensure that the column names are checked and specified accurately in the query when running the script.
